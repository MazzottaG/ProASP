## Compile a ASP program into an Hybrid Solver
In order to build an hybrid solver ProASP needs two files:
* "path/to_compile.asp": this file contains the rules that should be compiled into propagators
* "path/to_ground.asp": this file contains the rules that should be compiled into variable-elimination procedures

```
./dist/proasp --compile --source . --propagators path/to_compile.asp --grounding path/to_ground.asp
```

## Run an Hybrid Solver
In order to run an hybrid solver generated by ProASP, a file containing input facts is needed:
```
./dist/proasp --run --source . --instance path/to/instance/file
```
